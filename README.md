# AyeBae — Social & Shared Experience App

This repo contains the AyeBae project — a matching app for shared experiences (movies, music, dating) with live watch/listen parties, gifting, and subscriptions.

Quick start:
- See `docs/` for architecture and data model
- Service READMEs: `services/*/README.md` for per-service details
- For local env variables, copy `.env.example` → `.env`

If you'd like, I can initialize git, scaffold code for the first service, or create a GitHub repo and open a PR.
